The Technical Assistance Program is offered by Capital District Regional Planning Commission (CDRPC) and Capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC). The Technical Assistance Program is intended to offer staff time and expertise to local governments undertaking small scale community planning initiatives that resonate with the principles of CDTC’s New Visions 2040 Regional Transportation Plan. Planning initiatives that support New Visions include those that preserve and enhance the Capital District's existing urban form, infrastructure and quality of place; emphasize livable communities and smart growth; encourage concentrated development patterns and smart economic growth; and protect sensitive environmental resources. The Village of Menands is one of the five communities that were awarded funding for Food Access Best Practices and Feasibility in 2019. 

Food access in the was identified as a priority issue during the initial stages of the Village’s multi-year Comprehensive Planning process that began in 2017. At all stages of the Comprehensive Plan’s public engagement process- including stakeholder interviews, extensive surveying, and public workshops- residents expressed a desire for improved access to local grocery options. The back-to-back closure of two major food retailers in the Village prompted a sense of urgency amongst residents and elected officials. The Village sought assistance from the CDRPC in advance of the completion of the Comprehensive Plan as a way to take immediate action on the issue.

The Food Committee served to provide guidance on the technical assistance project, and the opening kick-off meeting was held on October 22, 2019. Existing conditions regarding food accessibility in Menands and national best practices within the topic were presented to members of the committee. Members were then asked to provide feedback on a prioritization of potential technical assistance tasks identified to assist Menands in improving the community’s access to healthy food:  
- Increase access to existing grocery establishments outside of Menands
- Improve food accessibility collaborating with existing community stores and entities in Menands
- Develop strategy to attract new grocery store/outlets

Upon further discussion with the committee, the approaches based on feasibility were narrowed down to the first two approaches; increase access to existing grocery establishments outside of Menands, and improve food accessibility within existing community stores in Menands. 

Based on the agreed consensus of the first meeting with the members of the Village of Menands food committee, the recommendations that provide strategies, potential partners, or activities designed to provide greater accessibility to food in short to long-term timeframes were developed. 

This report contains specific information related to the food accessibility issue as perceived within Menands, and strategic recommendations for how to improve food accessibility as provided within two main categories:
