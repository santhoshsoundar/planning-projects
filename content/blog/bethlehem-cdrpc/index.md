### Summary 
Bethlehem is a large town located in Albany County in the Capital District of New York, with a population most recently estimated to exceed 34,000 residents. The purpose of this analysis is to provide a tailored analysis of Bethlehem’s development trends as well as provide a comparison to selected peer communities within the Capital Region. To compare Bethlehem’s growth, this analysis will look at the time periods between 1995 and 2018. Looking at these two periods, as well as gathering data since 1990 will give us distinct periods of growth to compare and analyze. 

For this analysis, CDRPC will look at a variety of demographic indicators including population, population density, educational attainment, economic development, building permits, and more. CDRPC will also provide maps of Bethlehem to highlight residential development for the Town identified periods of 1991-2004 and 2005-2018. 

Data is drawn from a variety of sources, including Census data and data that CDRPC collects from other sources. Census data is typically retrieved from either the 10-year Decennial Census or the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). Data from the Decennial Census are exact counts, while data from the ACS are estimates. Though the ACS data is not exact, it is useful for determining trends.
Housing units increased by 20.4% between 1980-1990, but only increased 16% between 1990 to 2000.

### Some other notable highlights from our findings include: 
- Bethlehem’s population increased to 6,104 people between 1990 and 2010 and had a faster rate of growth than both the United States and Albany County between 2010 and 2017. Bethlehem increased by 4.2%, while Albany County increased by 1% in that time.

- The majority of Bethlehem’s population is between the ages of 25 and 59 years old for both males and females. This suggests that most of Bethlehem’s population is still in the workforce. A significant portion of the population is also between 5 and 14 years old, suggesting there are many families with children still at home. 

- Bethlehem has a higher share of its residents between ages 45 and 64 compared to the rest of the United States. The U.S. has 26.1% of its population between these ages while Bethlehem ha 29.9% of its residents in this age range.

- Bethlehem is a highly educated community, with 33% of residents having a Graduate or Professional degree, compared to only 11.8% throughout the rest of the country.

### Comparison to Peer Communities 
While it is beneficial to compare Bethlehem to the rest of the country as well as the United States overall, it can also be beneficial to compare to peer communities that are similar geographically. Comparing the profiles of Bethlehem to communities in the region of similar sizes can be beneficial to determine if Bethlehem is on trend with its peers or is an outlier in specific categories. For this report, we will be comparing Bethlehem to the Towns of Colonie, Halfmoon, Malta, and Rotterdam. Comparisons will be made between residential building permit issuance, educational attainment, affordability of housing in the respective communities, and other development and demographic areas.
