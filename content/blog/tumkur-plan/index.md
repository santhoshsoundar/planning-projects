The studio methodology was designed to work in four parts where the first part- Background Studies was intended to determine the objectives and desired outcomes of the study and acquire as much information as possible from online sources on the location and gather details on the scale and characteristics of the city and also to determine the nature of the study. Secondly, a thorough field visit to all the locations within the study area and gather both primary and secondary data on the city has been conducted. Thirdly, a thorough analysis of the acquired data to determine the issues, strengths, and challenges and finally strategizing the level of intervention and possible impacts on the community.
