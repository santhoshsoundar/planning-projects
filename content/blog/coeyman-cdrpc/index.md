### Summary:
The Technical Assistance Program is offered by the Capital District Regional Planning Commission (CDRPC) and the Capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC). The Technical Assistance Program is intended to offer staff time and expertise to local governments undertaking small scale community planning initiatives that resonate with the principles of CDTC’s New Visions 2040 Regional Transportation Plan.

Planning initiatives that support New Visions include those that preserve and enhance the Capital District's existing urban form, infrastructure, and quality of place; emphasize livable communities and smart growth;
encourage concentrated development patterns and smart economic growth; and protect sensitive environmental resources. The Town of Coeymans is one of the five communities that were awarded funding for technical assistance in preparation for the town’s forthcoming Comprehensive Plan Update.
